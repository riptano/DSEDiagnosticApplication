            <remarks>
            This method is equivalent to the FileStream(String, FileMode, FileAccess, FileShare) constructor overload 
            with file mode set to OpenOrCreate, the access set to Write, and the share mode set to None.
            
            The OpenTextWriter method opens a file if one already exists for the file path, or creates a new file if one does not exist.
            For an existing file, it does not append the new text to the existing text. Instead, it overwrites the existing characters with the new characters.
            If you overwrite a longer string (such as &quot;This is a test of the OpenWrite method&#8221;) with a shorter string (such as &#8220;Second run&#8221;), the file will contain a mix of the strings(&#8220;Second runtest of the OpenWrite method&#8221;).
